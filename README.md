# SelfBot
A small Java SelfBot made with [JDA3](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
# Dependicies
On your system you will need [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and working internet.
# Installation
Once you have the dependicies listed above installed correctly you can run the bot. 

Download the [launcher](https://ci.arsenarsen.com/job/SelfBot/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/launcher/target/Launcher-jar-with-dependencies.jar), double click it, or add `nogui` as an argument for CLI mode, and press Start. It will tell you it generated files. Click `Open Data Dir`. It will pop up Explorer, or Files, or whatever Mac uses, basically just the OS file manager. Go into the `UserBot` subdirectory and edit `settings.properties`. Edit the `token=` line and add in your token, and the `prefix=` line if you want to change your prefix. Default is `me.`  
**NOTE: You will do this only once..**

Your user token can be obtained by pressing `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I` in the Discord client or web app, navigating to the `Console` tab, and typing in `localStorage.token`. 
Take the part between the `"`s and put it into the settings file.

After all of that is done, just run the bot again, and have fun :)
