# SelfBot
A small Java SelfBot
# Dependicies
On your system you will need [correctly installed Maven](http://maven.apache.org/install.html), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
# Installation
Once you have the dependicies listed above installed correctly you can run the bot. It will generate a file for you to fill in.

Your user token can be obtained by pressing `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I` and typing in `localStorage.token`. 
Take the part between the `"`s and put it into the settings file.

Your user ID can be gotten by typing in `\@YourMention` and then copying the part between `<@` and `>`

After all of that is done, just run the bot again, and have fun :)
